** BIND in the Constraint

    ?s ?p ?o
    BIND(COUNT(?o) AS ?count)

when ?o is substituted with a value:

    ?s ?p <property>
    BIND(COUNT(<property>) AS ?count)

One solution(?):

    ?s ?p <property>
    BIND(COUNT(<property>) AS ?count)

** singleton VALUES statements for ?graph 

CONSTRUCT { ?s ?p ?o }
WHERE {
 {
  GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
  VALUES ?graph { <G1> <G2> }
  FILTER ( ?p != mu:uuid )
 }
 UNION
 {
  GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
  VALUES ( ?graph ?p ) { <GRAPHS/UUID> mu:uuid }
 }
}

Here, ?graph is not exclusively determined, so updates are not well-defined, unless
a triple is meant to go into all graphs. But how to define SELECT queries such as:

    SELECT *
    WHERE { ?a ?b ?c . ?d ?e ?f }

Can ?a ?b ?c and ?d ?e ?f come from different graphs, i.e., ?graph depends on ?s, ?p and ?o?
The current assumptions mean that they must be in the same graph for the query to succeed.

** singleton VALUES statements in general

how to calculate dependencies? with other singletons...
